# Space carbon nanomaterials
# Project Triangulene Spin Chains
# Default Experiment: TipTime_Q+_2021_05_24
# Preparation: PRE2 with Mol1 as parent and ANL6 (temperature: 700 and Type: Annealing) and SPT4 (Temperature:600 and Type: Sputtering) as children
# Annealing: Preparation (type: Cleaning) and SPT4 as parents
# Sputtering: Preparation as parent and ANL and SPM as children
# Spm measurement: SPT4 as parent. voltage: -2 and Dataset is a RAW_DATA type
# Preparation, Annealing, sputtering and spm measurement must be created
