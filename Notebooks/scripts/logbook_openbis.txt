Questions:

- When creating a new space, how to place it inside lab notebook or inventory?
- Unzipping a zip file in pybis dataset does not work right?
- In microscopy app, DAT files are now together in just one object. However, each data file has a different header. How are you going to handle this?

Notes: 

One can upload sxm and dat files to the same collection in openBIS. 
One just has to create a TEMPLATE-SXM and a TEMPLATE-DAT samples inside the collection and then change the experiment and sample inside nanonis_importer.py.
Bug in nanonis_importer on line 147. As it was getting all the possible channels from the files before getting the minimum and maximum of the files, there were some cases
where the channels did not exist and it was throwing a ValueError when using .index() in the list inside the function get_channel in spmpy_terry.py

Discussion about STM datasets:

Each STM session should be independent:
- Contains several SXM and several DAT and all of them go into the same view. If there are another session, it goes to another view.
- Check whether the openbis microscopy app follows the trees discussed at the beginning of PREMISE (SXM and DAT files trees)
- SXM and DAT files should be mixed and sequential.
- Replicate a small set of files that Bruno or Lysandr can give us.

Bug in microscopy app scripts:
- bug with div_00003.dat and 00004.dat
- Correct the python code (talk with Lysandr if needed)

Create the STM objects inside a collection in the project and then make these objects children of experiment step objects like Annealling, etc.
Changed math to numpy in nanonis_importer.py.
Added 'LI Demod 1 Y (A)','LI Demod 1 Y (A) [bwd] (A)' to channel names together with the respective elements to the other 3 groups??? Ask Lysandr
Change STM, AFM, STS, etc by 1D Measurements, 2D Measurements, 3D Measurements....
Bruno asked to present examples of how to build a Sample Preparation/Sample in openBIS.

How to store a sample preparation:
1- Store sample preparation tasks without making a specific object for sample. Connect measurements to the last sample preparation task.
2- Create a sample object and then connect the measurements to the last sample preparation task.
3- Create a Sample preparation object and connect sample object to it. Then connect sample to measurements.
4- Create a sample preparation object and no sample objects. Connect measurement to sample preparation object.
